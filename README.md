Day 10 of Spring Boot: Building a Robust REST API! <br>

Today’s Spring Boot journey was all about designing and building a REST API! Here’s what I learned: <br>

1) API Design Best Practices: Followed RESTful principles for clean, scalable APIs. <br>
2) Sample Data Setup: Preloaded data for testing and development. <br>
3) Project Setup: Created a REST project from scratch. <br>
4) DAO Layer: Built Data Access Objects for database interactions. <br>
5) Service Layer: Defined business logic to keep controllers clean. <br>
6) CRUD Operations: Implemented endpoints to Get, Add, Update, and Delete employees.
